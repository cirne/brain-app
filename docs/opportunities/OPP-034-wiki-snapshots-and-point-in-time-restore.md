# OPP-034: Wiki snapshots & point-in-time restore

## Summary

Capture **automatic, timestamped backups** of the wiki vault so users can **recover from a bad expansion, accidental edits, or agent mistakes** without a full factory reset ([OPP-032](archive/OPP-032-brain-hub-wiki-rebuild-and-factory-reset.md)). **Decided direction** (see [backup-restore.md](../architecture/backup-restore.md)): **compressed ZIP** archives under **`var/wiki-backups/`** (tenant-relative; [`shared/brain-layout.json`](../../shared/brain-layout.json) key `wikiBackups`), on a predictable cadence—e.g. **once per completed Your Wiki supervisor lap** ([OPP-033](OPP-033-wiki-compounding-karpathy-alignment.md))—with **retention limits** and a **Hub UX** to list, inspect, and restore. Prefer **skipping** a run when **`var/wiki-edits.jsonl`** shows no changes since the last wiki snapshot (optional manifest backstop for edits that bypass the log).

**Separate concern:** **Full-tenant** compressed archives to **object storage** (S3) for **DR, cell migration, and portability** are **heavier** and documented in [cloud-tenant-lifecycle.md](../architecture/cloud-tenant-lifecycle.md) / [OPP-096](OPP-096-cloud-tenant-lifecycle-s3-orchestration.md)—not the same as wiki-only history in `var/wiki-backups/`.

## Problem

- The wiki is **small, mostly text**, and **high leverage**: corruption or over-eager agent edits are painful.
- **Rebuild wiki** (OPP-032) is **nuclear**—users may want “go back to yesterday” instead of “start over.”
- **No product surface today** for “what did my wiki look like before that lap?”
- Manual recovery (Finder, Time Machine) is **possible but undocumented** and **not aligned** with split layout ([OPP-024](OPP-024-split-brain-data-synced-wiki-local-ripmail.md)) mental models.

## Goals

- **Automatic snapshots** on a clear trigger (default: **end of each supervisor lap**, or configurable interval).
- **Simple restore**: user picks a snapshot → confirms → **replaces live wiki tree** with archive contents (no git branches, no merge UI).
- **Inspectable backups**: user can **compare or browse** candidates before restoring.
- **Cross-platform friendly**: implementation should work on **macOS now** and **Windows later** without relying on OS-specific snapshot APIs.

## Non-goals

- Full **version control** UX (history per file, blame, branches).
- **Continuous** replication (full **tenant** archives to S3 / transitions are [backup-restore.md](../architecture/backup-restore.md) tier 2 + [OPP-096](OPP-096-cloud-tenant-lifecycle-s3-orchestration.md); this OPP stays **wiki-only local history**).
- Packing **entire** `BRAIN_HOME` into the **Hub “previous wiki version”** flow—full-tenant ZIP is for **DR/migration**, not per-lap rollback UX.

**Related (future collaboration):** [IDEA Wiki sharing with collaborators](../ideas/archive/IDEA-wiki-sharing-collaborators.md) may need **finer-grained** undo/blame than whole-vault ZIP restore; treat that as additive or superseding only after product decisions, not duplicate scope in OPP-034 v1.

**Related (Git per user):** Same idea file explores **one repo per user** for rollback/diff without bespoke history—vs ZIP snapshots and vs [PRODUCTIZATION § git friction](../PRODUCTIZATION.md#2-wiki-backing-store-git-friction); OPP-034 remains **snapshot-first** until an OPP explicitly adopts Git as the vault backing store.

## UX (discovery → inspect → restore)

**Placement:** Brain Hub **Data & recovery** (alongside [OPP-032](archive/OPP-032-brain-hub-wiki-rebuild-and-factory-reset.md)): section **“Wiki snapshots”** or **“Previous versions.”**

### List

- Rows sorted **newest first**: **timestamp** (local + optional UTC), **size**, **file count** (or “~N files” from manifest), optional **trigger** (“After lap 47 — cleanup”).
- **Retention copy:** “Keeping the last **K** snapshots” or “**~X MB** max” so expectations are clear.

### Inspect (before restore)

Users need confidence they’re picking the **right** moment:

- **Preview:** App extracts the ZIP to a **temp directory** (or streams a manifest generated at snapshot time) and offers:
  - **Tree summary** (top-level folders, recent paths), or
  - **Read-only browse** of a few key files (`me.md`, index pages) without mutating the live wiki.
- **Open in Finder / Explorer:** Reveal the `.zip` so power users can double-click or diff with external tools.
- Optional **lightweight diff** (later): “Files changed vs current wiki” using a manifest of paths + hashes captured at snapshot time—**not required for v1**.

### Restore

- **Strong confirmation:** short explanation that the **current wiki will be replaced**; recommend taking **one manual export** or rely on **auto pre-restore snapshot** (see below).
- **Safety valve:** Immediately before replace, write **one** “pre-restore” ZIP of the **current** broken tree (or move it aside) so the user can **undo a mistaken restore** without digging in Finder.
- **Operational:** Pause or **drain** wiki-writing agents during replace; **resume** after filesystem is consistent.
- **Post-restore:** Toast + link to wiki home; optional “re-run expansion” nudge if index looks empty (tie to OPP-032 flows, not automatic).

## Technical approaches

### A — Timestamped ZIP under `BRAIN_HOME` (recommended baseline)

**Layout:** `$BRAIN_HOME/var/wiki-backups/wiki-20260420T153022Z-lap47.zip` (see `wikiBackups` in [`shared/brain-layout.json`](../../shared/brain-layout.json); cross-link [OPP-012](OPP-012-brain-home-data-layout.md) when layout is updated there).

**Contents:** The `**wiki/`** directory as it exists on disk for the active vault root ([OPP-024](OPP-024-split-brain-data-synced-wiki-local-ripmail.md) — zip `**BRAIN_WIKI_ROOT/wiki**`, not `BRAIN_HOME/wiki` when split).

**Pros**

- **Portable**, **inspectable** with any OS zip tool; **compresses well** for markdown-heavy trees.
- **Windows-ready:** Node can create/read ZIP without native snapshot APIs.
- **Simple mental model:** one file = one point in time.

**Cons / mitigations**

- **Consistency:** snapshot while writers are active risks torn state. **Mitigation:** snapshot **after** a lap boundary when the supervisor is idle; optionally take a **two-phase** copy (copy tree to temp, then zip) or use OS `rsync`/recursive copy then zip.
- **iCloud / sync:** wiki may be on a synced volume; zips in `BRAIN_HOME` stay **local**—good default ([OPP-024](OPP-024-split-brain-data-synced-wiki-local-ripmail.md) cautions on syncing SQLite, not markdown vault read-mostly).
- **Very large wikis:** set **max count + max total bytes**; drop oldest.

### B — Local git repository (optional / advanced)

Initialize a **bare or non-bare** repo beside or under the vault, commit **only** on snapshot triggers.

**Pros:** Efficient deltas; familiar to developers; possible future “diff to commit.”

**Cons:** `**.git` may already exist** in user wiki; **merge/rebase** semantics leak into support; **Windows** path + line-ending friction; **harder** for non-technical “pick a zip and restore” story. Better as a **power-user** or **export** path than the primary backup mechanism.

**Verdict:** Prefer **ZIP for product UX**; git could be **documentation** (“you may also use your own git remote”) rather than built-in v1.

### C — Filesystem snapshots (Time Machine, VSS)

**Pros:** Zero app code; captures everything on volume.

**Cons:** **Not app-controlled**, **not discoverable** in Hub, **platform-specific**, restore granularity is **volume-level** or awkward. Treat as **complement**, not the Brain-native solution.

## Trigger & retention


| Knob          | Suggested default                                                                                                |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **When**      | End of each **Your Wiki** supervisor lap (success path); **skip if unchanged** (see `var/wiki-edits.jsonl` vs last snapshot high-water mark in [backup-restore.md](../architecture/backup-restore.md)) |
| **Retention** | Last **15–30** snapshots **or** ~**500 MB–1 GB** total, whichever bound hits first (tunable)                     |
| **Manual**    | Hub button **“Snapshot wiki now”**                                                                               |


**Sidecar metadata (optional JSON next to zip):** `lap`, `phase`, `wikiRoot`, `fileCount`, `bytes`, `contentHash` for UI and for “skip if unchanged.”

## Implementation sketch

- **Server module:** `createWikiSnapshot(reason)`, `listWikiSnapshots()`, `restoreWikiSnapshot(id)`, `extractWikiSnapshotPreview(id) → tempPath` with tests mirroring [dev route](archive/OPP-032-brain-hub-wiki-rebuild-and-factory-reset.md) patterns.
- **Atomic restore:** extract to **temp**, **rename swap** into place (platform-specific care on Windows: extract then move tree), or delete+replace in one transaction where the FS allows.
- **Permissions:** Same **local-only** stance as destructive Hub actions; no remote API.

## Relationship to other OPPs

- [OPP-032](archive/OPP-032-brain-hub-wiki-rebuild-and-factory-reset.md): snapshots are **before** rebuild/reset; restore is **lighter** than full rebuild.
- [OPP-024](OPP-024-split-brain-data-synced-wiki-local-ripmail.md): snapshot source path must follow **wiki root** resolution (`brainWikiParentRoot()` / `wikiDir`).
- [OPP-033](OPP-033-wiki-compounding-karpathy-alignment.md): **lap completion** is the natural hook for automatic snapshots.
- [OPP-012](OPP-012-brain-home-data-layout.md): wiki snapshot archives live under **`var/wiki-backups/`** (`wikiBackups` in [`shared/brain-layout.json`](../../shared/brain-layout.json)); do **not** place giant zip trees **inside** the synced wiki folder unless the user opts in.
- [backup-restore.md](../architecture/backup-restore.md): **ADR** — wiki-only ZIP history vs full-tenant S3 archives.
- [OPP-096](OPP-096-cloud-tenant-lifecycle-s3-orchestration.md): hosted **full-tenant** durability / migration (ZIP direction; implementation may use tar where faster—see [cloud-tenant-lifecycle.md](../architecture/cloud-tenant-lifecycle.md)).

## Status

**Decided direction** ([backup-restore.md](../architecture/backup-restore.md)) — Hub UX, triggers, and implementation still **not shipped**; technical approaches **§ B/C** remain optional adjuncts.
