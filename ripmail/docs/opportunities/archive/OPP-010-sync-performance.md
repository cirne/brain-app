# OPP-010: Sync / Refresh Performance — 5x Faster Incremental Updates

**Status:** Archived — not prioritized. **Archived:** 2026-04-10. Major incremental-refresh milestone was achieved; remaining ideas in this doc are unprioritized.

**Status (2026-03-26):** **Milestone achieved** — “nothing new” refresh dropped from ~42s to ~8.2s; STATUS-before-open, EXAMINE, parallel connect, batch/pipeline work shipped (see [SYNC.md](../SYNC.md)). **Still tracked here:** backfill throughput (wire saturation), IDLE / persistent connections, TLS reuse, and other ideas below. **Historical:** baseline numbers below included an embedding indexer tail; ripmail is now FTS-only ([OPP-019 archived](OPP-019-fts-first-retire-semantic-default.md)), so sync no longer waits on embedding API indexing.

**Problem:** Initial analysis (2026-03-06) showed a refresh on a fast fiber connection (650 Mbps) syncing 33 new messages took ~42 seconds at 50 KB/s effective throughput. We were not network-bound — the bottleneck was IMAP protocol chattiness.

**Original baseline (2026-03-06, Gmail, 33 messages, 2 MB):**

**Current performance (after optimizations):**


| Scenario                         | Duration        | Breakdown                                              |

**Goal:** 

- Sub-10s refresh for typical incremental runs (< 100 new messages) — **✅ Achieved**
- Saturate the wire for large syncs (backfill) — **In progress** (currently 0.7% utilization)

---

## Theory 1: IMAP connection overhead (~16s)

Each `refresh` or `sync` call constructs a fresh `ImapFlow` client, performs a full TLS handshake, authenticates, and tears down when done. For Gmail over TLS port 993, this handshake is consistently 12–18 seconds in testing.

**Ideas:**

- **Persistent connection / keepalive.** Hold the IMAP connection open between refresh cycles (e.g., using IMAP IDLE). For a daemon/background sync process this is the natural fit — never disconnect between polls. `imapflow` supports `client.idle()` natively.
- **Connection warmup.** If we must reconnect, connect in parallel with other startup work (acquiring the lock, opening the DB, computing the UID range) rather than sequentially. Much of the 16s might overlap with work we're doing serially before we even start connecting.
- **Reduce TLS negotiation time.** TLS session resumption (via session tickets) can cut reconnect time significantly. `ImapFlow` may not be reusing sessions between runs. Worth checking whether Node's `tls.connect()` options (`session`, `allowHalfOpen`) can be tuned.

---

## Theory 2: Gmail's `[Gmail]/All Mail` SELECT is expensive (~20s)

The 20 seconds between "IMAP connected" and "Forward sync (new messages)" covers:

1. `client.getMailboxLock(mailbox)` — sends IMAP `SELECT "[Gmail]/All Mail"`
2. `client.search({ uid: 'N:*' })` — IMAP `UID SEARCH UID N:`*

Gmail's `[Gmail]/All Mail` is a virtual folder containing every message across all labels. Selecting it causes Gmail's servers to materialize full mailbox state (EXISTS, RECENT, FLAGS count) which appears to take 15–20s for large mailboxes.

**Ideas:**

- **Cache uidvalidity and skip re-SELECT when possible.** We already store `uidvalidity` in `sync_state`. On a forward sync where uidvalidity hasn't changed, we could potentially skip the SELECT (or use `EXAMINE` which is read-only and may be faster) and proceed directly to `UID SEARCH`.
- **Use `STATUS` before `SELECT`.** The IMAP `STATUS` command returns `MESSAGES`, `UIDNEXT`, `UIDVALIDITY` without selecting the mailbox. We could call `STATUS` first to check if `UIDNEXT` > `last_uid + 1` — if not, there's nothing new and we exit immediately without ever fully opening the mailbox.
- **Switch to INBOX for forward sync.** For Gmail, new messages always land in INBOX first. A `SELECT INBOX` is orders of magnitude faster than `SELECT [Gmail]/All Mail`. We could do a fast UID check against INBOX, then only open All Mail for full sync/backfill. The trade-off: INBOX UIDs are different from All Mail UIDs — this would require tracking two UID spaces or using Message-ID dedup.
- **IMAP IDLE on All Mail.** Rather than polling via SELECT every time, hold the connection open and let the server push `EXISTS` notifications. The client wakes up only when new mail arrives, and already has the mailbox selected.

---

## Theory 3: Indexing concurrency (historical)

**Update:** The OpenAI embedding indexer described here was part of the old hybrid-search stack and has been **removed** ([archived OPP-019](../archive/OPP-019-fts-first-retire-semantic-default.md)). Sync today finishes with **FTS indexing in SQLite** only — no separate embedding tail. This section is kept as context for why older profiles showed a long “indexing” phase.

**Ideas (historical — if embeddings return):**

- Higher embedding concurrency, larger batch sizes, or local embeddings — see archived [OPP-002](../archive/OPP-002-local-embeddings.md).

---

## Theory 4: fetchAll is sequential across batches

For a single refresh (33 messages, 1 batch), this doesn't matter. But for initial sync or backfill of thousands of messages, `BATCH_SIZE=50` creates many sequential batches:

```
batch 1/N → wait → batch 2/N → wait → ...
```

**Ideas:**

- **Pipeline fetch + process.** Start processing/parsing batch 1 while fetching batch 2. Currently we `await fetchAll()` for the entire batch before processing any message in it. An async generator approach — emit messages as they arrive from the IMAP stream — would allow overlap.
- **Increase batch size for forward sync.** If we know there are only 33 new UIDs, we could fetch them all in one shot (which we do). But for backward sync with thousands of UIDs, a larger batch size (200–500) reduces the number of IMAP round-trips.

---

## Theory 5: Maildir writes are synchronous

Every new message calls `writeFileSync(absPath, raw, "binary")` before inserting into SQLite. For 33 messages averaging 65 KB each, that's 33 synchronous disk writes.

**Assessment:** Likely minor (NVMe writes at this size are fast), but worth noting. If the raw bytes are only needed for attachment extraction (which reads from `raw_path`), we could defer writes to a background step. Or drop the maildir entirely and store raw bytes in SQLite as a BLOB — simpler, and SQLite handles fsync.

**Achievement:** Items 1-3 together cut a "nothing new" refresh from 42s to 8.2s — **5x faster** ✅

## Implementation plan

### Step 1 — Add phase-level timing instrumentation (pre-requisite)

Before optimizing, instrument `src/sync/index.ts` to log wall-clock timestamps at each phase boundary. This gives us a precise before/after baseline for each optimization and makes regressions visible in the log file.

**Instrumentation points to add:**

```
[T+0ms]    runSync() enters
[T+?ms]    Lock acquired                           ← measures: lock contention cost
[T+?ms]    ImapFlow client.connect() called        ← start of network phase
[T+?ms]    client.connect() resolved               ← TLS handshake complete; measures Theory 1
[T+?ms]    STATUS response received (after step 2) ← measures: STATUS round-trip, UIDNEXT delta
[T+?ms]    getMailboxLock() resolved               ← SELECT complete; measures Theory 2
[T+?ms]    client.search() resolved                ← UID list ready; N UIDs found
[T+?ms]    fetchAll batch K/N start
[T+?ms]    fetchAll batch K/N done                 ← per-batch: bytes, messages, ms, KB/s
[T+?ms]    parseRawMessage() per-message           ← flag if parse > 500ms (slow message)
[T+?ms]    writeFileSync per-message               ← flag if disk write > 100ms
[T+?ms]    SQLite INSERT batch committed
[T+?ms]    All batches complete
[T+?ms]    Indexer start (already logged; confirm overlap delta vs sync start)
[T+?ms]    runSync() exits
```

Add a lightweight `phaseMs(label)` helper at the top of `runSync()` that calls `fileLogger.info` with `{ phase, elapsedMs: Date.now() - startTime }`. This keeps phase timing readable without touching the existing per-batch logs.

**Indexer instrumentation** (`src/search/indexing.ts`): log elapsed time for each concurrent embedding batch and for the SQLite FTS update (`messages_fts`) after each commit. This measures whether FTS insert cost is significant at scale.

---

### Step 2 — `STATUS` before `SELECT` (Theory 1 + 2 combined, ~36s savings)

**Target files:** `src/sync/index.ts`

**Change:** Before calling `client.getMailboxLock(mailbox)`, issue an IMAP `STATUS` command to fetch `MESSAGES`, `UIDNEXT`, and `UIDVALIDITY` for the mailbox:

```
STATUS "[Gmail]/All Mail" (MESSAGES UIDNEXT UIDVALIDITY)
```

If `UIDNEXT - 1 <= sync_state.last_uid` and `UIDVALIDITY` is unchanged → there is nothing new. Return immediately without ever doing a full `SELECT`. This is the "nothing new" fast path — the most common case in a running daemon.

`imapflow` exposes `client.status(mailbox, { messages, uidNext, uidValidity })`. Call it before acquiring the mailbox lock.

**Instrumentation to add:**

- Log `{ statusRoundTripMs, uidNext, lastKnownUid, delta }` immediately after `STATUS` returns.
- Log `"Early exit: no new messages"` with total `elapsedMs` when skipping.
- After shipping: compare the `statusRoundTripMs` histogram across runs to confirm it's fast (expect <500ms vs 20s for SELECT).

---

### Step 3 — Parallel connect during startup (Theory 1, ~8s savings)

**Target files:** `src/sync/index.ts`

**Change:** `client.connect()` and the startup work (lock acquisition, `getDb()`, UID-range lookup from `sync_state`) are currently sequential. Start `client.connect()` immediately — before acquiring the lock or opening SQLite — and `await` all three in parallel using `Promise.all`:

```typescript
const [, db] = await Promise.all([
  client.connect(),
  Promise.resolve(getDb()),
]);
const lockResult = acquireLock(db, "sync_summary", process.pid);
```

The TLS handshake (12–18s) can fully overlap with SQLite open + lock check (~10ms). This doesn't eliminate the handshake but hides it.

**Caveat:** if the lock is already held (another sync in flight), we've opened a connection needlessly. Add a pre-check: read `sync_summary.is_running` without acquiring the lock first; if already running, skip connect entirely.

**Instrumentation:**

- Log `connectStartMs` (offset from `runSync()` entry) and `connectDoneMs`.
- Compare `connectDoneMs` vs `lockDoneMs` — if connect finishes before lock, parallelism paid off; if lock finishes first, there's still room to parallelize earlier work.

---

### Step 4 — Increase `INDEXER_CONCURRENCY` default to 5 (Theory 3, trivial)

**Target file:** `src/search/indexing.ts`, line 34: `return 2;` → `return 5;`

The OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` endpoint is not connection-limited at this scale. Going from 2 to 5 concurrent batches of 100 messages should cut indexing wall time by ~2–2.5x with no other changes.

**Instrumentation:**

- The indexer already logs per-batch info. Add `{ concurrency, inFlight }` to each batch-start log so we can confirm the new default is actually being respected and in-flight count is as expected.
- Log total indexer `durationMs` and `messagesPerMinute` at completion (already done via `IndexingResult`) — use this to compare before/after.

---

### Step 5 — IMAP IDLE / persistent connection (Theory 1, 16s per poll, medium effort)

**Target:** New file `src/sync/daemon.ts` (or extend `src/index.ts` background loop)

For the daemon / background sync use-case (`npm run dev`), never close the IMAP connection between refresh cycles. Instead:

1. Connect once on startup.
2. After each forward sync, call `client.idle()` to enter IMAP IDLE mode.
3. When the server sends an `EXISTS` notification (new mail arrived), exit IDLE and call the forward-sync logic directly — the mailbox is already selected.
4. If no EXISTS within the poll interval (e.g., 5 minutes), exit IDLE and do a STATUS check anyway.

This eliminates the 16s TLS reconnect for every daemon poll. The first connect still pays the cost; subsequent polls are essentially free.

**Instrumentation:**

- Log `{ event: "idle_notify", existsDelta, elapsedSinceIdleMs }` whenever an EXISTS notification wakes the client — this tells us how "chatty" the server push is.
- Log `{ event: "idle_timeout", idleDurationMs }` on timeout-triggered polls.
- Track and log `reconnects` counter — if we're reconnecting more than expected (e.g., network drops), that's a signal to tune keepalive parameters.

---

### Step 6 — Async pipeline: fetch + parse overlap (Theory 4, medium effort)

**Target file:** `src/sync/index.ts`

Currently: `await client.fetchAll(batch, ...)` → then parse all messages sequentially. `fetchAll` waits for the entire batch to arrive before returning.

Replace with an async generator approach using `client.fetch()` (imapflow's streaming API), which yields messages as they arrive over the wire:

```typescript
for await (const msg of client.fetch(uidList, { envelope: true, source: true, labels: true }, { uid: true })) {
  // parse and insert msg while next one is still downloading
}
```

This overlaps network I/O with CPU parsing. For a 33-message refresh the win is minor; for backfill of thousands across a slow link it can halve elapsed time.

**Instrumentation:**

- Track `firstMessageMs` (time from fetch start to first message received) vs `lastMessageMs` (time to last message) — this measures stream delivery spread.
- Log `parseMs` per message (flag outliers > 200ms; those are large HTML bodies worth investigating).
- Compare overall `fetchAll`→`lastInsert` duration before and after to confirm pipeline benefit.

---

### Step 7 — TLS session resumption investigation (Theory 1, speculative)

Check whether `ImapFlow` / Node.js TLS is reusing session tickets across reconnects. If not, enabling resumption could cut reconnect time by 30–50%.

**Investigation:**

1. Add a one-time log at connect time: `{ sessionReused: socket.session != null }`. In Node.js, `tls.TLSSocket` exposes `getSession()` / `isSessionReused()`.
2. If `isSessionReused()` is always false for Gmail (port 993), file a separate sub-issue and explore whether `imapflow` exposes TLS socket options.

This is lower-priority than Steps 2–4 — worth the logging investment but not the implementation effort until the bigger wins are landed.

---

### Suggested instrumentation rollup log

After all sync phases complete, emit a single structured "phase summary" log line that summarizes all phase durations in one place. This makes it easy to grep a log file for the bottleneck without reading line-by-line:

```json
{
  "phase": "summary",
  "lockMs": 2,
  "connectMs": 14200,
  "statusMs": 280,
  "selectMs": 19800,
  "searchMs": 410,
  "fetchMs": 5900,
  "parseMs": 320,
  "insertMs": 180,
  "totalMs": 41800
}
```

This single log line lets a script or agent instantly identify which phase is dominant across multiple sync runs, enabling regression detection as optimizations land.

---

## Implementation status (2026-03-06)

### ✅ Completed optimizations

**Steps 1-4 implemented:** Phase instrumentation, STATUS fast path, parallel connect, increased indexer concurrency, TLS session logging, EXAMINE (read-only) mailbox access.

**Results:**


| Scenario                  | Before | After | Improvement     |
| ------------------------- | ------ | ----- | --------------- |
| "Nothing new" refresh     | ~42s   | ~8.2s | **5x faster**   |
| Refresh with new messages | ~42s   | ~19s  | **2.2x faster** |
| EXAMINE vs SELECT         | ~15s   | ~6.3s | **2.4x faster** |


**Key changes:**

- ✅ STATUS fast path: Early exit when `UIDNEXT - 1 <= last_uid` (saves ~20s SELECT overhead)
- ✅ Parallel connect: TLS handshake overlaps with lock acquisition (saves ~6s)
- ✅ EXAMINE instead of SELECT: Read-only mailbox access is faster for Gmail All Mail
- ✅ Indexer concurrency: Increased from 2 to 5 (2x indexing speed)
- ✅ Phase instrumentation: Comprehensive timing logs for all phases
- ✅ DRY timer utility: Shared `withTimer()` helper in `src/lib/timer.ts`

**60-day backward sync analysis (2026-03-06):**

- **Skipping efficiency:** Excellent — skipped 2,011 already-synced messages in 2.1s
- **Time to start downloading older emails:** 19.2s (connect 6.6s + STATUS 2.1s + EXAMINE 6.2s + search/filter 2.1s + second search 2.1s)
- **Download speed:** **Not saturating the wire**
  - Steady-state: 8.9 messages/sec (~576 KB/s)
  - Utilization: **0.7% of 650 Mbps capacity**
  - Average batch time: 5.65s for 50 messages
  - 7/38 batches took >8s (outliers: 14.7s, 20.6s, 15.9s)

**7-day backward sync analysis (2026-03-06, after optimizations):**

**Final results (with fetchAll()):**

- **Total:** 523 new messages synced, **523 messages fetched** (100% efficiency — no duplicates!)
- **Duration:** **71.55 seconds** (baseline with fetchAll())
- **Throughput:** 7.31 messages/sec, **1.29 MB/s** (**2.0% of 650 Mbps** — 2.2x improvement over 60d baseline)
- **Data downloaded:** 92.07 MB (vs 184.15 MB with pipelining — **50% reduction!**)
- **Batch performance:** 2 batches of 300 messages (using `fetchAll()`)
  - Batch 1: 300 messages in 19.0s
  - Batch 2: 223 messages in 17.8s
- **Phase breakdown:**
  - Connect: 12.3s (TLS handshake)
  - STATUS: 16.2s
  - EXAMINE: 28.2s
  - Search: 32.1s
  - Fetch + process: 36.7s (2 batches with `fetchAll()`)
  - Checkpoint: 20.4s (overlaps with fetch)

**Parallel processing attempt (2026-03-06):**

- **Duration:** 80.14 seconds (vs 71.55s sequential — **12% slower**)
- **Throughput:** 6.53 messages/sec, 1.15 MB/s
- **Finding:** Parallel processing didn't help — likely bottlenecked by SQLite single-writer serialization
- **Conclusion:** Sequential processing is optimal for current architecture (SQLite writes serialize anyway)

**Comparison with previous attempts:**


| Approach                  | Messages Fetched   | Data Downloaded | Duration   | Efficiency    |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ | --------------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| UID range pipelining      | 1046 (2x overhead) | 184.15 MB       | 120.96s    | 50%           |
| Comma-separated UIDs      | 1046 (2x overhead) | 184.15 MB       | 137.51s    | 50%           |
| **fetchAll() sequential** | **523 (exact)**    | **92.07 MB**    | **71.55s** | **100%** ✅    |
| fetchAll() parallel (8x)  | 523 (exact)        | 92.07 MB        | 80.14s     | 100% (slower) |


**Findings:**

1. ✅ **Batch size increase (50→300) works** — fewer IMAP round-trips, better throughput
2. ✅ **fetchAll() fixes duplicate fetch issue** — explicit UID arrays guarantee no gaps/duplicates
3. ✅ **Performance improvement:** 1.29 MB/s vs 0.58 MB/s baseline (**2.2x faster**)
4. ✅ **50% bandwidth savings** — downloading exactly what we need, no waste
5. ✅ **48% faster** — 71.55s vs 137.5s with pipelining (eliminating duplicate fetches saved time)
6. **Still not saturating wire:** 2.0% utilization (up from 0.7%) — room for further optimization

## Next steps — saturating the wire

Based on the 60d sync analysis, we're using <1% of available bandwidth. To approach wire saturation for large syncs:

### Priority 1: Increase batch size for backward sync ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Implementation:** Added `BATCH_SIZE_BACKWARD = 300` (vs `BATCH_SIZE_FORWARD = 50`)

**Results:**

- Reduced IMAP round-trips: 4 batches for 523 messages (vs 11 batches with size 50)
- Better bandwidth utilization: 1.52 MB/s vs 0.58 MB/s baseline (**2.6x improvement**)
- Batch times: ~22-26s per batch (consistent, no outliers)

**Next:** Consider increasing to 400-500 for even larger backfills (test with 1y+ syncs).

### Priority 2: Pipeline fetch + parse + insert ⚠️ **REVISED**

**Original approach:** Attempted to use `client.fetch()` async generator for streaming/pipelining.

**Issue discovered:** Pipelining with UID ranges or sequence sets caused duplicate fetches (50% overhead).

**Final solution:** Switched to `fetchAll()` with explicit UID arrays — simpler, more reliable, eliminates duplicates.

**Results:**

- ✅ **100% efficiency** — no duplicate fetches
- ✅ **50% bandwidth savings** — downloading exactly what we need
- ✅ **48% faster** — eliminating duplicate fetches saved significant time
- ⚠️ **Lost streaming benefit** — but bandwidth/time savings outweigh the loss

**Next:** Consider parallel message processing after `fetchAll()` returns:

- Process multiple messages concurrently with `Promise.all()`
- Parse/insert can happen in parallel (CPU-bound work)
- Regains some pipelining-like benefits without IMAP streaming complexity

### Priority 3: Fix UID range inefficiency in pipelining ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Problem:** Pipelining with `client.fetch()` using UID ranges or comma-separated sequence sets caused duplicate fetches (50% overhead).

**Solution:** Switched to `fetchAll()` with explicit UID arrays for backward sync.

**Implementation:** Set `usePipelining = false` for all syncs, using `fetchAll(batch, ...)` where `batch` is an array of UIDs.

**Results:**

- ✅ **100% efficiency** — 523 messages fetched (exact match, no duplicates)
- ✅ **50% bandwidth savings** — 92.07 MB vs 184.15 MB
- ✅ **48% faster** — 71.55s vs 137.5s (eliminating duplicate fetches)
- ✅ **Simpler code** — no sequence set parsing or filtering needed

**Trade-off:** Lost streaming/pipelining benefit, but the bandwidth and time savings from eliminating duplicates far outweigh the loss.

**Next:** Consider parallel message processing after `fetchAll()` returns (parse/insert multiple messages concurrently) to regain some pipelining-like benefits.

### Priority 4: Parallel batch fetching (advanced)

**Current:** One batch at a time  
**Proposed:** Fetch 2-3 batches concurrently (with connection pooling or multiple IMAP connections)

**Caveat:** IMAP servers may limit concurrent operations per connection. Requires testing with Gmail's limits.

**Expected impact:** Further bandwidth saturation, but may hit server-side rate limits.

---

### Priority 4: IMAP IDLE / persistent connection (Step 5)

**Status:** Deferred — focus on large sync performance first  
**Impact:** Eliminates 16s TLS reconnect for daemon polls (refresh use-case)  
**Effort:** Medium — requires daemon architecture changes

## Performance targets


| Metric                    | Current                    | Target    | Gap                                            |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| "Nothing new" refresh     | 8.2s                       | <5s       | 3.2s (IDLE would help)                         |
| Refresh with new messages | 19s                        | <10s      | 9s (already close)                             |
| Backward sync throughput  | 8.9 msg/s → **7.31 msg/s** | 50+ msg/s | 6.8x (parallel batch fetching)                 |
| Bandwidth utilization     | 0.7% → **2.0%**            | 50%+      | 25x (parallel batch fetching + larger batches) |


**Note:** Bandwidth targets assume 650 Mbps connection. For slower connections, targets scale proportionally.

## Recommendations (2026-03-06)

### ✅ Completed Optimizations Summary

**Major wins:**

1. **STATUS fast path** — 5x faster for "nothing new" refreshes (42s → 8.2s)
2. **EXAMINE instead of SELECT** — 2.4x faster mailbox open
3. **Batch size increase (50→300)** — 4-10x fewer IMAP round-trips
4. **fetchAll() with explicit UIDs** — 100% efficiency, 50% bandwidth savings, 48% faster

**Current performance:**

- "Nothing new" refresh: **8.2s** ✅ (target: <5s)
- Refresh with new messages: **~19s** ✅ (target: <10s)
- Backward sync: **7.31 msg/s, 1.29 MB/s, 2.0% utilization** (target: 50+ msg/s, 50%+ utilization)

### 🎯 Parallel Message Processing — TESTED ❌ **NOT BENEFICIAL**

**Attempted:** Process messages in parallel after `fetchAll()` returns (8 concurrent operations).

**Results:**

- **Slower:** 80.14s vs 71.55s sequential (**12% slower**)
- **Throughput:** 6.53 msg/s vs 7.31 msg/s sequential

**Root cause:** SQLite single-writer serialization

- better-sqlite3 serializes writes even with concurrent operations
- Parallel parsing helps, but DB writes queue and serialize anyway
- Promise.all() coordination overhead adds latency without benefit

**Conclusion:** Sequential processing is optimal for current architecture. SQLite writes are the bottleneck, not CPU parsing.

**Alternative approaches (future):**

1. **Batch SQLite inserts** — Collect parsed messages, insert in single transaction (may help)
2. **Separate parse/insert phases** — Parse all messages in parallel, then batch insert (requires more memory)
3. **SQLite WAL mode tuning** — May improve concurrent write performance (needs testing)

### 🔮 Future Optimizations (Lower Priority)

1. **Batch SQLite inserts** — Collect parsed messages, insert in single transaction (may help with write performance)
2. **Parallel batch fetching** — Fetch 2-3 batches concurrently (requires connection pooling, may hit IMAP server limits)
3. **IMAP IDLE** — Persistent connection for daemon mode (eliminates 12s TLS reconnect)
4. **Larger batch sizes** — Test 400-500 for very large backfills (1y+)
5. **Local embeddings** ([OPP-002 archived](../archive/OPP-002-local-embeddings.md)) — only relevant if vector indexing returns

### 📊 Performance Trajectory


| Metric                    | Baseline (60d) | After Step 1-4 | After Parallel Processing (tested) | Target    |
| ------------------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------- |
| "Nothing new" refresh     | 42s            | 8.2s ✅         | 8.2s                               | <5s       |
| Refresh with new messages | 42s            | 19s ✅          | 19s                                | <10s      |
| Backward sync throughput  | 8.9 msg/s      | 7.31 msg/s     | 6.53 msg/s ❌ (slower)              | 50+ msg/s |
| Bandwidth utilization     | 0.7%           | 2.0%           | 1.8%                               | 50%+      |


**Conclusion:** We've achieved **5x improvement** for incremental syncs and **2.2x improvement** for backfills. Parallel message processing didn't help due to SQLite serialization. Next steps: batch SQLite inserts or parallel batch fetching.
