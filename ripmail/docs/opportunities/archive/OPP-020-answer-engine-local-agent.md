# OPP-020: Answer Engine — Local Agent for Faster Email Queries

**Status:** Archived — mostly implemented. **Archived:** 2026-04-10. Phase 1 CLI `ripmail ask` shipped; optional transport and tuning remain in this doc.

**Phase 1 (CLI) shipped** — `ripmail ask` runs the internal pipeline (`src/ask/`). **Open:** MCP single-tool exposure (`ask_email` or similar), formal bakeoff vs Gmail MCP latency targets, optional shortcuts/tuning. **Updated:** 2026-03-26.

**Created:** 2026-03-08.

**Problem:** ripmail matches or slightly lags Gmail MCP in bakeoff wall-clock time despite faster individual tool execution. The bottleneck is the orchestrating agent: high tool count and complex tool interface force use of a high-power/slower LLM (e.g. Opus 4.6). Each round costs 15-25s. A typical query takes 3-4 rounds (search → read → follow-up → synthesize) = ~50-100s. The vast majority of that time is LLM deliberation, not tool execution.

**Constraint:** Optimizing ripmail's primitive tools cannot fix this. The only path to meaningful improvement is to move orchestration inside ripmail: a faster/smaller LLM focused on email Q&A, with a purpose-built internal tool interface, so the user (or a future agent interface) sees a single "ask" and gets an answer — with zero or one external LLM round.

**Direction:** ripmail is an **answer engine** for the CLI: `ripmail ask "<question>"` returns a synthesized answer; orchestration runs inside ripmail (`src/ask/agent.ts`). **Still deferred:** exposing the same pipeline as an MCP tool so outer agents get one round instead of many primitive calls. Success criteria (e.g. ≥50% wall-clock vs Gmail MCP on bakeoff questions) remain useful for validation when we re-run benchmarks.

## The Performance Gap

### Bakeoff data (2026-03-07)

| Interface | Tool calls | Wall-clock | LLM thinking % |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| ripmail CLI | 8 (12 tool uses) | 99s | 99% |
| ripmail MCP | 11 (19 tool uses) | 96s | 97% |
| Gmail MCP | 13 tool uses | 74s | 91% |

Gmail won despite having more tool calls and slower individual calls. Its structured responses are information-dense — agents extract what they need faster and synthesize sooner.

### Why this can't be fixed incrementally

OPP-018 (richer search output, batch reads) would reduce rounds and help, but the fundamental constraint remains: **each external LLM round costs 15-25s.** The current approach needs a powerful/slower model (Opus 4.6) to orchestrate many tools well. The only way to break through is to move orchestration inside ripmail with a faster/smaller model and a brilliant internal tool interface.

**Validation target:** Re-run the same bakeoff questions against the new answer-engine flow. Success = **at least 50% latency improvement vs Google MCP** (e.g. ~50s → ~25s). We have enough bakeoff results to compare. Further improvement (e.g. toward 15-20s) is low-hanging fruit after that.

| Approach | Expected wall clock | Notes |
|----------|---------------------|-------|
| Current (ripmail MCP + Opus) | ~96-99s | Baseline; ≈ equal to Gmail MCP |
| Google MCP (bakeoff) | ~74s | Comparison baseline |
| Answer engine (CLI prototype) | Target ≤25s | 50%+ improvement vs Gmail; validate first |
| Answer engine (tuned) | 15-20s | Room for improvement after validation |
| Answer engine (future MCP tool) | 15-20s + 1 outer round | If/when we expose ask as a tool |

## Architecture: "ripmail ask"

### The idea

Single entry point; all orchestration inside ripmail:

```
User → ripmail ask "summarize my tech news this week" → synthesized answer (streaming)
```

No hardcoded pipeline. An **internal micro-agent** runs an agentic loop: the fast LLM chooses which internal tools to call (search, get_messages, who, get_thread, etc.), executes them locally (sub-millisecond), and repeats until it has enough to answer. Each internal round is cheap (~200-500ms LLM + negligible tool time), so 3-4 rounds still land under the latency target. Specialization is not "five fixed query types" — it's **"I know how to find answers in email lightning fast in a very small number of turns."**

### Internal tool interface (purpose-built, not external)

The interface between the internal LLM and ripmail is **entirely different** from what we would expose externally. It is designed for one consumer: the fast model.

- **Email-native primitives:** search (FTS + from/to/date/subject), get_messages (batch bodies with previews), who (resolve person → addresses + relationship), get_thread (full conversation). Information-dense responses so the model often needs fewer rounds.
- **No prescriptive flow:** the model decides order and how many steps. Aim for as few turns as possible; no hard cap.
- **Swappable LLM provider:** easy to support (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic). No dependency on Pi or other harnesses; we own the loop.

**MCP:** Primitive tools remain the MCP surface; a dedicated `ask`-style MCP tool is **still deferred**. The primary shipped surface for the answer engine is **`ripmail ask "<question>"`** (CLI).

### Why the internal model is fast

The outer LLM (e.g. Opus in Cursor) is slow because every round carries:
- Full conversation history (often 50k+ tokens)
- All tool schemas and descriptions
- System prompt, user rules, file contents
- Prior tool call/response pairs

ripmail's internal model sees only:
- A tight system prompt (~200 tokens)
- The user's question (~20 tokens)
- Tool definitions (small set) and the last few tool results (~2-5k tokens)

Small context = fast inference. A model like GPT-4.1 mini or Claude Haiku with 3-5k input tokens responds in 1-2s per round.

---

## Model Selection

The internal model should be:
- **Fast:** 1-3s response time for typical queries
- **Cheap:** pennies per query, not dollars
- **Good enough:** doesn't need to be frontier-quality — the task is summarization and extraction over pre-selected content, not open-ended reasoning

Candidates:

| Model | Speed | Cost (per 1M tokens) | Notes |
|-------|-------|---------------------|-------|
| GPT-4.1 mini | ~1-2s | $0.40 in / $1.60 out | Strong, fast, cheap |
| GPT-4.1 nano | <1s | $0.10 in / $0.40 out | Fastest, may be too weak for complex synthesis |
| Claude 3.5 Haiku | ~1-2s | $0.80 in / $4.00 out | Good quality, moderate cost |
| Local (Llama 3, Phi-3) | varies | free | No API dependency, but requires GPU or is slow on CPU |

**Recommendation for experiment:** Start with GPT-4.1 mini. It's the best speed/quality/cost balance. The `RIPMAIL_OPENAI_API_KEY` infrastructure already exists.

## Intent and retrieval (no fixed flow)

We do **not** rely on a fixed set of rule-based intents as the foundation. The internal agent uses **LLM-driven tool use** as the primary path: the model sees the question and the internal tools (search, get_messages, who, get_thread), and decides what to call. That works for any question shape. Rule-based shortcuts for common patterns (e.g. "tech news", "spending on X", "who is X") can be added later as optimizations to reduce turns or latency; they are not required for Phase 1.

The internal tools are designed so that the fast LLM can get maximum signal per call (information-dense, email-native), keeping the number of internal rounds low. No hardcoded pipeline; the model controls the flow.

### Design Philosophy: Generalized vs Overfitted

The answer engine avoids overfitting to specific test cases (e.g., "try apple.com when searching for apple"). Instead, it uses **generalized mechanisms** that work for any query:

- **Result feedback** — tools provide hints based on result patterns (0 results, low diversity, more available)
- **High default limits** — 50+ results by default catches more cases without hardcoding
- **General prompt guidance** — "try variations if 0 results" works for any query type

**Why this is better:**
- Works for any domain (Apple, Amazon, travel, events, etc.)
- Adapts to new query types without prompt changes
- Tool feedback guides the model dynamically, not hardcoded rules

---

## What gets returned (CLI)

Stream the answer to stdout as the model generates (`ripmail ask`). Optionally include timing or metadata (e.g. pipeline ms, model used) for bakeoff comparison — same questions, measure wall clock vs Google MCP.

Example:

```
$ ripmail ask "summarize my tech news this week"

Here are the key tech stories from your newsletters this week:

**AI & LLMs**
- OpenAI released GPT-4.1...
- Anthropic announced...

**Industry**
- Apple's WWDC dates confirmed for June...

Sources: TLDR (Mar 7, Mar 6), The Information (Mar 7), ...
```

When we expose an MCP interface (e.g. `ask_email`), we can return structured JSON (answer, sources, searchesRun, pipelineMs) so callers can cite or drill deeper — still **deferred** (see Phase 2).

---

## Approaches Considered

### 1. Better documentation / Cursor skill (rejected as primary strategy)

A skill teaching Claude the optimal ripmail query patterns would reduce wasted rounds (e.g., teaching `from:apple.com` instead of `"apple.com"`). But it cannot overcome the 15-25s per-round floor. Expected improvement: ~3x (100s → 35s). Not enough.

**Still worth doing** as a complement — if the outer LLM does call ripmail tools, a skill helps. But it's not the 10x lever.

### 2. Richer tool responses / OPP-018 (complementary, not sufficient)

Body previews, batch reads, attachment indicators — these reduce rounds from 3-4 to 1-2. Expected improvement: ~2x. Valuable and complementary, but moving orchestration inside ripmail (answer engine) is what delivers the 50%+ latency win vs Google MCP.

**These improvements also help the answer engine** — richer search results mean the internal pipeline has more to work with before needing follow-up queries.

### 3. Answer engine with semantic / hybrid search (rejected for the shipped stack)

Historically, LanceDB + per-query embeddings were considered; embedding latency could be hidden inside a longer pipeline.

**Rejected because:** The hybrid semantic stack was removed in favor of FTS-only ([archived OPP-019](OPP-019-fts-first-retire-semantic-default.md)). If semantic search is **reintroduced** for `ask`, prefer:
- **sqlite-vec** — embeddings in SQLite, one file, no LanceDB dependency
- **Local or index-time embeddings** — no per-query API call
- Tight integration with the query planner, not generic hybrid RRF merge

This is a Phase 2 optimization (see below), not a prerequisite for the experiment.

### 4. Pi (badlogic) or other agent harness (rejected for Phase 1)

Using Pi's SDK or agent framework would provide a ready-made tool loop and multi-provider support. We are not using it: we are not building many pluggable tools or providers; a minimal agent loop and swappable LLM are straightforward to implement ourselves. Keeps dependencies and complexity low for the experiment.

### 5. Pre-built intent shortcuts (optional later)

Deterministic pipelines for common patterns (`ripmail news`, `ripmail spending`, `ripmail flights`) could be added as optimizations. Not required for Phase 1; the internal agent loop handles arbitrary questions first.

---

## Phasing

### Phase 1: Validate the architecture (CLI) — **delivered**

**Shipped:** `ripmail ask <question>` (`src/ask/`): internal micro-agent loop with email-native tools, FTS-backed search, streaming answer to stdout, verbose mode for timings.

**Still useful:** Re-run bakeoff questions and measure wall clock **vs Google MCP** (≥50% improvement was the original bar; treat as ongoing evaluation, not blocking).

**Original non-goals that remain open:**
- MCP `ask_email` or equivalent — still deferred ([OPP-023](OPP-023-ask-only-interface.md) discusses full removal of primitives)
- Rule-based intent shortcuts — optional later
- Semantic search / embeddings — out of scope (FTS-only; see archived [OPP-019](OPP-019-fts-first-retire-semantic-default.md))

### Phase 2: External interface + tuning

- Expose `ask` via optional non-CLI transport when MCP returns — see [OPP-039](../OPP-039-mcp-deferred-cli-first.md)
- Add rule-based shortcuts for high-frequency patterns if data supports it
- Tune internal tools and prompts based on Phase 1 usage
- Decide strategy for primitive tools (keep alongside ask, or make ask the default)

### Phase 3: Semantic search (if needed)

- sqlite-vec for embeddings in SQLite; local or index-time embeddings
- Only if Phase 1/2 show FTS + tool loop insufficient for some query types

## Tradeoffs and Risks

### Benefits

- **Target: ≥50% latency improvement vs Google MCP** on same bakeoff questions (e.g. ~50s → ~25s), with room to go lower
- **CLI shipped** — `ripmail ask` is the validated path; MCP wrapper for the same pipeline is optional next step
- **Model control** — ripmail uses a fast/cheap model for the task; no dependency on a heavy orchestrator (Opus, etc.)
- **Purpose-built internal tools** — email-native, information-dense; not a generic tool library
- **Streaming** — answers appear progressively

### Risks

- **API key dependency** — `ask` requires an LLM key (e.g. `RIPMAIL_OPENAI_API_KEY`). Mitigatable with swappable providers or local models later.
- **Answer quality ceiling** — fast/small models may be worse than frontier models at synthesis; the bet is they are good enough for email Q&A over pre-selected content.
- **Transparency** — user sees the answer, not the internal tool calls. Can expose sources/metadata when we add an external interface.
- **Two interfaces eventually** — primitive tools (search, read, who) vs answer engine. Phase 1 only builds ask; strategy for coexistence decided in Phase 2.

### Open questions

- **Cost per query:** GPT-4.1 mini ~$0.003/query at typical usage; acceptable. Worth tracking.
- **Local model viability:** Could a local model (Llama 3 8B, Phi-3) give acceptable quality at target latency? Would remove API dependency. Phase 2.
- **Positioning:** ripmail may evolve from "tool library for agents" toward "the agent that manages my email." UI/agent interface deferred; we validate speed and quality first.

## Relationship to Other Work

| Item | Impact |
|------|--------|
| **OPP-018** (reduce round-trips) | **Archived** (phase 1 done). [OPP-018 archived](OPP-018-reduce-agent-round-trips.md) — richer search + batch read still help the answer engine's internal pipeline. |
| **OPP-019** (FTS-first) | **Implemented** (archived). Answer engine uses FTS for retrieval; vector pipeline removed. |
| **OPP-002** (local embeddings) | **Archived / superseded** unless vector retrieval returns; then sqlite-vec + local model over LanceDB. |
| **BUG-016** (exhaustive search) | Still relevant — the answer engine's spending/receipt intents need exhaustive `from:` queries. Domain auto-routing fix benefits both architectures. |
| **STRATEGY.md** | May need updating. The answer engine shifts ripmail from "queryable dataset for agents" toward "intelligent email assistant." The local-index moat argument still holds — the answer engine runs on the local index. |
