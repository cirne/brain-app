# BUG-007: Sync Silent Authentication Failure — Agent-Reported

**Status:** Fixed. Verified 2026-03-07; closed.

**Design lens:** [Agent-first](../VISION.md) — silent failures are especially harmful for LLM agents; without an error message, the agent cannot self-correct or understand what went wrong. This is the most critical onboarding bug: a user who typos their password will think everything worked, proceed to search, get 0 results, and have no idea why.

**Reported context:** Agent on macOS (Darwin 25.3.0); config with invalid IMAP credentials set up via `ripmail setup --no-validate`. Reproducibility: Always (with invalid IMAP credentials).

---

## Summary

After running `ripmail setup --no-validate` with invalid credentials, `ripmail sync` reports "Sync complete! 0 messages synced and indexed" with exit code 0, even though the background sync process crashed during IMAP connection. The sync log shows the process got stuck at `lock_acquired` phase and never progressed — no error was logged. The foreground process apparently doesn't wait for the background sync to confirm IMAP auth before printing the success message.

---

## What the agent did (and what happened)

1. Set up with invalid credentials:
   ```bash
   ripmail setup --email "test@gmail.com" --password "fake-password" --openai-key "sk-fake123" --no-validate
   ```
2. Ran sync:
   ```bash
   ripmail sync --since 7d
   ```
3. **Expected:** Error message indicating IMAP connection/authentication failure, with exit code 1. Example:
   ```
   Sync failed: Could not authenticate with IMAP server. Check your credentials.
   ```
4. **Actual:** Success message with exit code 0:
   ```
   Connecting to IMAP server at imap.gmail.com...

   Sync running in background.
     PID:    38552
     Log:    /Users/cirne/.ripmail/logs/sync.log
     Status: ripmail status

   Sync complete! 0 messages synced and indexed.
   Try: ripmail search "your query"  |  ripmail who "name"
   ```
   The sync log (`~/.ripmail/logs/sync.log`) shows the process got stuck at `lock_acquired` phase and never progressed — only 5 lines written, ending at:
   ```
   [2026-03-07T15:36:33.839Z] INFO  Phase {"phase":"lock_acquired","elapsedMs":19}
   ```
   No error was logged. The background process crashed silently.

---

## Root causes

1. **Foreground doesn't wait for auth:** The foreground process doesn't wait for the background sync to confirm IMAP authentication before printing the success message.
2. **Background crash not surfaced:** The background sync process crashes silently during IMAP connection, but the error is never logged or reported back to the foreground process.
3. **"0 messages" not flagged:** The "0 messages synced" output should at minimum trigger a warning like "No messages found — check your credentials and date range."

---

## Recommendations (concise)

1. **Validate IMAP connection before backgrounding:** Consider validating IMAP connection *before* backgrounding the sync, so auth errors surface immediately.
2. **Wait for initial auth confirmation:** The foreground process should wait for the background sync to confirm successful IMAP authentication before printing success.
3. **Surface background errors:** Background sync errors (including auth failures) should be logged and reported back to the foreground process.
4. **Warn on 0 messages:** When 0 messages are synced, emit a warning suggesting the user check credentials and date range.

---

## Fix

Fixed by pre-validating IMAP credentials in the foreground process before spawning the background sync subprocess. The CLI makes a lightweight IMAP connect/auth/disconnect attempt; if auth fails, it reports the error immediately (exit 1) and never spawns the background process. This eliminates the entire class of "silent background auth failure" regardless of timing, log parsing, or first-time vs. repeat sync.

Additionally:
1. Explicitly catching and logging IMAP connection errors in `src/sync/index.ts`
2. `checkSyncLogForErrors()` function as a safety net for non-auth errors in background sync
3. Warnings when 0 messages are synced (may indicate other issues)

Test case: `src/cli/sync-auth-failure.test.ts` verifies the fix (pre-auth prevents background process from spawning).
